# PaintPond
Paint with a painter. This is something I made for this video: âœ¨ **[NEW Cellular Automata](https://youtu.be/WMJ1H3Ai-qs)**

Try it at [paintpond.cool](https://paintpond.cool)!

# Controls
**Number keys**: Change colour!<br>
**Tab key**: Change painter!<br>
**Space bar**: Enter [screenshot mode](docs/screenshot-mode.md)!

**X key**: Undo!<br>
**C key**: Clear the screen!<br>

## Running Locally
To run locally...<br>
you need to run a local server because it uses javascript modules.<br>
(ie: you can't just open `index.html` like most of my other projects)<br>

I recommend getting [deno](https://deno.land)
and then installing `file_server` with this command:
```
deno install --allow-read --allow-net -f https://deno.land/std@0.142.0/http/file_server.ts
```
Then you can run this command to run a local server:
```
file_server
```
